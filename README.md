# youtube-simple-bulk-publish-drafts

## Overview

This is a simple script to automate publishing drafts in YouTube Studio. From https://www.youtube.com/my_videos, copy the contents of "code.js" and paste into browser Dev Console. It can also be executed by typing "javascript:" into the browser bar, and pasting the code afterwards. The script will recursively step through each draft on the page until it runs out of drafts

## Config

You can configure whether the video should be published as Made For Kids and set the visibility using the CONFIG constant defined at the top of the script
